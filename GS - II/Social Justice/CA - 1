### LYNCHING:
	# In recent times we observer lynching of two types -  
	a) By Cow-Vigilant group
	b) By Muslim led attack

	a) By COW-VIGILANT group :
		* Incidents: 
			- Aklaq Khan - 2016 - Dadri
			- Junaid Khan - 15 year - Jun 2017 - Delhi Mathura train
			- Alimuddin Ansari - Jun 2017 - Jharkhand
		* PM Modi Condemned the recent lynching events by Gau-Rakshaks from Sabarmati.
		* Prez commented on recent lynching events: "Mob frenzy beecomes so high and irrational"
		* Intentions of larger Hindutava group:
			To cast a miasma of fear and trepidation over entire regions, and to put minorities and the so-called lower castes ‘in their place’. 


	# Some important Court cases for "Right to life" under article 21.
		a) Case of A.K. Gopalan vs the State of Madras, 
			Interpreted the phrase “procedure established by law” as any procedure laid down in a statute enacted by a competent legislature. For 23 years, the court did not interpret the right to life as a principle of natural justice, but as a fragile right that could be taken away by arbitrary legislation.
		b) Case of Prabhu Dayal Deorah vs the District Magistrate, Kamrup:
			The court ruled that anti-social activities can never be reason to invade the personal liberty of citizens.
		C) Maneka Gandhi case (1977) 
			The court ruled that the right to life had to be read along with the right to equality and the right to freedom, granted by Articles 14 and 19 of the Fundamental Rights Chapter. Any procedure that could possibly infringe on the right to life and personal liberty had to be right, just, and fair, and not arbitrary, fanciful and oppressive. The court would decide whether a procedure is just. 

	# Protests at Delhi with the title NOT IN MY NAME:
		* Means: 
			The marker of the protest can be read in two ways. 
				a) It can be interpreted as distancing ourselves from the barbarism that has been unleashed on vulnerable Indians. But this reading is untenable. 
				b) This form of protest is one of the most spectacular expressions of loss of confidence in elected leaderships, a mass no-confidence motion. We are no longer ‘the people’ in whose name you rule.
		* Lynching = Murder.

	# Consequences:
		* People in search of protection cluster together. The political community fragments, and the collective self of India is once again fractured.

### “LIVING HUMAN ENTITY” TO GANGA AND YAMUNA:
	# Uttarakhand HC’s order:
		* The order issued in exercise of parens patrie (authority regarded as legal protector of citizens who are unable to protect themselves) jurisdiction said “the rivers Ganga and Yamuna, all their tributaries, streams, every natural water flowing with flow continuously or intermittently of these rivers, are declared as juristic/legal persons/living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person in order to preserve and conserve river Ganga and Yamuna”.

		* It also declared the Director of the Namami Gange project, the Chief Secretary of Uttarakhand and the Advocate General of the state “loco parents” — the human faces to protect, conserve and preserve the rivers and their tributaries. These officers were bound to uphold the status of the rivers Ganges and Yamuna and also to promote the health and well-being of these rivers.

	# Concerns:
		* The order had put the state government in a quandary. Since the rivers flow through several states, only the Centre could frame rules for their management. The ruling also raised questions like whether the victim of a flood in the rivers can sue the state for damages and also about whether the state and its officers will be liable in case of pollution in the rivers in another state through which it flows.

	# SC stays HC verdict on Ganga status
		* The Supreme Court has stayed the Uttarakhand High Court order according the status of “living human entity” to Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
