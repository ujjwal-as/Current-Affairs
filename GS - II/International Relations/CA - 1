	* Context:
		China’s action of sending People’s Liberation Army construction teams with earth moving equipment to forcibly build a road upsets a carefully preserved peace.

		- Indian army blockade the construction of road by China in Doklam.
		
	* Other issues of India w.r.t to China
		Disappointment over China’s rejection of its concerns on sovereignty issues, 
		Refusal to corner Pakistan on cross-border terrorism,
		Help India’s bid for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership.

	* China's stand:
		- Precondition for dialogue: Withdrawal of Indian troops.
		- Released map to claim that Indian troops "transgressed" into Doklam area of Sikkim sector which is under their territory. 

	* Bhutan's Saying:
		- Protested that the debated area is under their territory and Chinese action is violative of 1988 and 1998 agreements.


### PM Modi's ISRAEL visit:
	* Agreement over non-security issues including:
		- Agriculture, Water, Science, Technology and Space. Including a $40 million joint fund for R&D in innovations, with both countries contributing $20 millions each.
		- List of Agreements:
			1. Agreement in fields of water deals with increasing awareness of need for conservation;
				Isarel Water Ministry & U.P. Jal Nigam signed an MoU.
			2. MoUs on space coorperation included one for ELECTRIC PROPULSION for SMALL SATTELLITES, and for the development of an optical link, as well as cooperation on atomic clock.
			3. Fund of R&D called "I4F" or India Isarel Industrial Innovation Fund. 
	* No agreement on security issues in Jul-17 visits. But talked on 'Joint Development of Defense Products including transfer of technology from Israel'. 
	* Israel far ahead in WATER RECYCLING:
		- They desalinate 90% of water used in their households from sea.
		- Recycle 95% of their sewage water for agriculture.
		- Hence, Israelians are not dependent on rains for water supplies.
		- After Israel, Spain recycles its water but it comes to 17% so less than Israel.
	* Gifting Israel, relics of their past:
		- 1. Cherished relic for Cochin Jews :- 
			It is regarded as a charter describing the grant of hereditary royal privileges and prerogatives by the Hindu king Cheraman Perumal (often identified as Bhaskara Ravi Varma) to Jewish leader Joseph Rabban.
		- 2. Second set of copper plates is believed to be the earliest documentation of the history of Jewish trade with India.
			These plates describe the grant of land and tax privileges by the local Hindu ruler to a church and oversight of trade in Kollam to West Asian and Indian trading associations. 

### NORTH KOREA - ICBM(Inter-continental ballastic missile)
	* Trump accused China of non-cooperation in dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat, and threatened retaliatory trade against Beijing.
	* ICBM could reach US west by North Korea.
	* In the fight against North Korea, South Korea is with USA but wants to explore diplomatic options.
	* Options in front of US:
		- Trump has simply followed the Obama administration’s stick-and-sanctions policy towards the North, but with a China emphasis.
		- To continue the tested-and-failed policy of sanctions and international isolation, which would mean more trouble for the North Korean people with an uncertain effect on the roguish regime. It is also unclear whether China will back such isolation.
		- Direct negotiations with Pyongyang.

### PERTOLEUM:
	## WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AT ISTANBUL, TURKEY
	# About WPC conference
		* The tri-annual WPC Conference is widely recognized as the `Olympics` of the oil and gas industry.
    	* It attracts Ministers, CEOs of Oil and Gas MNCs, experts and academics from the hydrocarbon sectors and provides an ideal forum to showcase potential of countries’ hydrocarbon sector.
    	* It also provides a platform to interact with policy makers, technologists, scientists, planners and management experts.

		* The 22nd World Petroleum Congress (WPC) International Conference has begun at Istanbul, Turkey. India is also taking part in the conference.

### NUCLEAR ENERGY:
	
	## 122 COUNTRIES ADOPT GLOBAL TREATY BANNING NUCLEAR WEAPONS
		* A global treaty banning nuclear weapons was recently adopted at the United Nations. The treaty was adopted by a vote of 122 in favour with one country — NATO member The Netherlands voting against —while Singapore abstained.

		# Key facts:
	    	* Led by Austria, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and New Zealand, 141 countries joined in drafting the treaty that they hope will increase pressure on nuclear states to take disarmament more seriously.
	    	* The treaty prohibits a full range of nuclear-weapon related activities, such as undertaking to develop, test, produce, manufacture, acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, as well as the use or threat of use of these weapons.
	    	* None of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons — the United States, Russia, Britain, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — took part in the negotiations or the vote.
	    	* Even Japan — the only country to have suffered atomic attacks, in 1945 — boycotted the talks as did most NATO countries.

		# Treaty being opposed, because:
			* Nuclear powers argue their arsenals serve as a deterrent against a nuclear attack and say they remain committed to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). They said a purported ban on nuclear weapons that does not address the security concerns which continue to make nuclear deterrence necessary cannot result in the elimination of a single nuclear weapon and will not enhance any country’s security, nor international peace and security.

### U.S. ON F-1 STUDENT VISAS:

	# U.S. may tighten rules for foreign students
		* US is planning to tighten rules for foreign students. A proposal is under consideration by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
	    * The proposal is part of an ongoing review of the immigration policy to ensure that it “promotes the national interest, enhances national security and public safety and ensures the integrity of our immigration system.”

	# Current regulations:
		* Under current regulations, international students can stay in the U.S. as long as they are enrolled for a programme. Students who enter the U.S on F-1 visas are issued an entry document with an end date that states “duration of stay”, which is theoretically open-ended. They can stay as long as they have a valid I-20 document, which is issued by the university, with all details regarding the student’s programme of study, financing, etc. They can also move from one programme to another and from one institution to another, by a notification to the DHS, based on a new I-20 document that the institution issues.

	# Implications of the new move:
		* Foreign students in the United States may be required to reapply every year for permission to stay in the country. It will make their visa status time-bound. The proposed measures could increase costs and paper work for students and universities.

	# Implications for India:
		* Since the proposal requires fees to be paid each time a student reapplies, it could make the U.S. a less attractive destination for students from India.

		* Indians are the fastest growing group among the international student population in the U.S. There are 1,66,000 students from India pursuing higher education in the U.S. now, up from about 1,00,000 two years earlier. A large majority of them pursue science, technology, engineering and math courses. Around 1.4 million international students are currently present in the U.S.

### SASEC - SOUTH ASIAN SUB-REGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION
	## About SASEC:
		* Established in 2001, the SASEC program is a project-based partnership to promote regional prosperity by improving cross-border connectivity, boosting trade among member countries and strengthening regional economic cooperation.
	    * ADB is the secretariat and lead financier of the SASEC program, which to date has supported a total of 46 projects worth $9.17 billion in transport, trade facilitation, energy and information and communications technology (ICT).
    	* The SASEC OP, endorsed in June 2016 by the SASEC member countries, is SASEC’s first comprehensive long-term plan to promote greater economic cooperation among the member countries in the areas of transport, trade facilitation, energy, and economic corridor development.
    	* Bringing regional cooperation to a higher level, the SASEC OP plans to extend physical linkages not only within SASEC but also with East and Southeast Asia by the next decade.

	# Cabinet approves SASEC Road Connectivity Investment Program
		* The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister has given its approval for upgradation and widening of 65 kms of Imphal-Moreh Section of NH-39 in Manipur. The project is being developed with ADB’s loan assistance under the South Asian Sub-Regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Road Connectivity Investment Program.

    	* The project corridor is also a part of the Asian Highway No. 01 (AH01) and acts as India’s Gateway to the East. Thus trade, commerce and tourism in the region will get a boost.


### INDIA-BANGALDESH
	## Cabinet approves Joint Interpretative Notes(JIN) between India, Bangladesh
		* The Union Cabinet has given its approval for the Joint Interpretative Notes (JIN) on the agreement between India and Bangladesh for the promotion and protection of investments between the two countries.
		* The JIN includes interpretative notes to be jointly adopted for many clauses, including, the definition of investor and investment, exclusion of taxation measures, Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET), National Treatment (NT) and Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment, expropriation, essential security interests and settlement of disputes between an investor and a contracting party.

		# Significance of the JIN:
		    * Joint Interpretative Statements play an important supplementary role in strengthening the investment treaty regime. With increasing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) disputes, issuance of such statements was likely to have strong persuasive value before tribunals.
		    * The JIN would impart clarity to the interpretation of the existing agreement between India and Bangladesh for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (BIPA).


### DIJBOUTI
	# About Dijbouti:
		Djibouti, officially the Republic of Djibouti, is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden at the east.
	# China sends PLA unit to man overseas base
		China has dispatched People’s Liberation Army (PLA) personnel to man its first overseas military base at Djibouti in the strategic Indian Ocean region, a move likely to spark concerns in the U.S.

	# Base at Djibouti:
		* The establishment of the PLA Djibouti base was a decision made by the two countries after friendly negotiations, and accords with the common interest of the people from both sides. The base is aimed at ensuring China’s performance of missions, such as escorting, peace-keeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and West Asia.

		* The base will also conduct overseas tasks, including military cooperation, joint exercises, evacuating and protecting overseas Chinese and emergency rescue, as well as jointly maintaining security of international strategic seaways.

	#Why is US worried?
	    * Base at Djibouti is close to Camp Lemonnier. Established after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Camp Lemonnier is home to 4,000 personnel. Some are involved in highly secretive missions.
		* Strategists worry that a naval port so close to Camp Lemonnier could provide a front-row seat to the staging ground for U.S. counterterrorism operations in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa.
		* The base, which is run by the Navy and abuts Djibouti’s international airport, is the only permanent U.S. military installation in Africa.
