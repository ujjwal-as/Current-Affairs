### Doka La Trijunction (India-Bhutan-China)
Context:
	China’s action of sending People’s Liberation Army construction teams with earth moving equipment to forcibly build a road upsets a carefully preserved peace.

Indian stand:
	- Beijing must recognise the special relationship India and Bhutan have shared since 1947, the friendship treaty of 2007 that commits India to protecting Bhutan’s interests, and the close coordination between the two militaries.
	- Indian army blockade the construction of road by China in Doklam.
	
Other issues of India w.r.t to China
	Disappointment over China’s rejection of its concerns on sovereignty issues, 
	Refusal to corner Pakistan on cross-border terrorism,
	Help India’s bid for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership.

China's stand:
	- Precondition for dialogue: Withdrawal of Indian troops.
	- Released map to claim that Indian troops "transgressed" into Doklam area of Sikkim sector which is under their territory. 

Bhutan's Saying:
	- Protested that the debated area is under their territory and Chinese action is violative of 1988 and 1998 agreements,
