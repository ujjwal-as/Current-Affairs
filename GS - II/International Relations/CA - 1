### DOKA LA TRIJUNCTION (India-Bhutan-China)
	* Context:
		China’s action of sending People’s Liberation Army construction teams with earth moving equipment to forcibly build a road upsets a carefully preserved peace.

	* Indian stand:
		- Beijing must recognise the special relationship India and Bhutan have shared since 1947, the friendship treaty of 2007 that commits India to protecting Bhutan’s interests, and the close coordination between the two militaries.
		- Indian army blockade the construction of road by China in Doklam.
		
	* Other issues of India w.r.t to China
		Disappointment over China’s rejection of its concerns on sovereignty issues, 
		Refusal to corner Pakistan on cross-border terrorism,
		Help India’s bid for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership.

	* China's stand:
		- Precondition for dialogue: Withdrawal of Indian troops.
		- Released map to claim that Indian troops "transgressed" into Doklam area of Sikkim sector which is under their territory. 

	* Bhutan's Saying:
		- Protested that the debated area is under their territory and Chinese action is violative of 1988 and 1998 agreements.


### PM Modi's ISRAEL visit:
	* Agreement over non-security issues including:
		- Agriculture, Water, Science, Technology and Space. Including a $40 million joint fund for R&D in innovations, with both countries contributing $20 millions each.
		- List of Agreements:
			1. Agreement in fields of water deals with increasing awareness of need for conservation;
				Isarel Water Ministry & U.P. Jal Nigam signed an MoU.
			2. MoUs on space coorperation included one for ELECTRIC PROPULSION for SMALL SATTELLITES, and for the development of an optical link, as well as cooperation on atomic clock.
			3. Fund of R&D called "I4F" or India Isarel Industrial Innovation Fund. 
	* No agreement on security issues in Jul-17 visits. But talked on 'Joint Development of Defense Products including transfer of technology from Israel'. 
	* Israel far ahead in WATER RECYCLING:
		- They desalinate 90% of water used in their households from sea.
		- Recycle 95% of their sewage water for agriculture.
		- Hence, Israelians are not dependent on rains for water supplies.
		- After Israel, Spain recycles its water but it comes to 17% so less than Israel.
	* Gifting Israel, relics of their past:
		- 1. Cherished relic for Cochin Jews :- 
			It is regarded as a charter describing the grant of hereditary royal privileges and prerogatives by the Hindu king Cheraman Perumal (often identified as Bhaskara Ravi Varma) to Jewish leader Joseph Rabban.
		- 2. Second set of copper plates is believed to be the earliest documentation of the history of Jewish trade with India.
			These plates describe the grant of land and tax privileges by the local Hindu ruler to a church and oversight of trade in Kollam to West Asian and Indian trading associations. 

### NORTH KOREA - ICBM(Inter-continental ballastic missile)
	* Trump accused China of non-cooperation in dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat, and threatened retaliatory trade against Beijing.
	* ICBM could reach US west by North Korea.
	* In the fight against North Korea, South Korea is with USA but wants to explore diplomatic options.
	* Options in front of US:
		- Trump has simply followed the Obama administration’s stick-and-sanctions policy towards the North, but with a China emphasis.
		- To continue the tested-and-failed policy of sanctions and international isolation, which would mean more trouble for the North Korean people with an uncertain effect on the roguish regime. It is also unclear whether China will back such isolation.
		- Direct negotiations with Pyongyang.
