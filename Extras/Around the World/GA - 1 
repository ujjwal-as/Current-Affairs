### Grand al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul: Iraq
Context: Among the most important city of Iraq.
	The capture by Iraqi forces of the Grand al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul, from where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself ‘caliph’ in July 2014, marks the end of the ‘caliphate’ in Iraq. 
Question mark on Iraqi Army:
	The ease with which the IS took Mosul, home to over a million people, had raised alarming questions about the professional capability of the Iraqi army to defend its territory against further possible IS expansion.
Fight with Jihadists:
	Elite Iraqi counter-terror forces led the ground battle, 
	Iran-trained Shia Popular Mobilization Units as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga militia also joined in. The U.S. provided air cover
Upcoming Challenge:
	1. Rebuild the mosque, and relocate thousands of people displaced.
	2. Prepare to face IS's retalliation.
