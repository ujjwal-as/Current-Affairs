1) CAPE ratio:
	"A ratio used to gauge whether a stock (or an index) is undervalued or overvalued by comparing its current market price to its inflation-adjusted historical earnings record. It is a variant of the more popular price-to-earnings ratio, and is calculated by dividing the current price of a stock by its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last ten years. Using average earnings over the last decade helps to smooth out the impact of business cycles and other events, and gives a better picture of a companyâ€™s sustainable earnings power. The ratio was invented by American economist Robert Shiller."
