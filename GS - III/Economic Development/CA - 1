		POSITIVE SIDE OF GST:-
			a. One tax subsume maby taxes
			b. Captures nearly all transcations above certain limit
			c. Eleminates cascading effect at various level of value chain
			d. Enlarge tax base
		DESIGN FLAWS OF GST:-
			a. GST should have one standard rate (with cocessional rate and demrit rate) but we have several slabs
			b. GST implemented as diarchy but needs to be a unified ax
			c. Number of tar return filings by a merchant is way too high. eg, Per state of trade around 37 times per year.
			d. GST should have eleminated classification dispute, but it didn't.
			e. GST should reduce the discretion of tax administrator but it didn't.
