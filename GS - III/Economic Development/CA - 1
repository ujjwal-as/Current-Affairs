### GST:
	# Against the way of GST implementation (by P.Chidambram)-
		POSITIVE SIDE OF GST:-
			a. One tax subsume maby taxes
			b. Captures nearly all transcations above certain limit
			c. Eleminates cascading effect at various level of value chain
			d. Enlarge tax base
		DESIGN FLAWS OF GST:-
			a. GST should have one standard rate (with cocessional rate and demrit rate) but we have several slabs
			b. GST implemented as diarchy but needs to be a unified ax
			c. Number of tar return filings by a merchant is way too high. eg, Per state of trade around 37 times per year.
			d. GST should have eleminated classification dispute, but it didn't.
			e. GST should reduce the discretion of tax administrator but it didn't.
			f. No trial run period. (atleast 2 months must have been given for transational duration) 

	# Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SDGC) demanded, exemption of langer from GST, as they are non-profit organisation, & it will lead to additional Rs.10cr of burden to the trust. Even in VAt era also they were exempted.

	# Effect on Tamil Nadu's Cinema Tickets:
		- Taxes which are there: 
			a) GST (28%) - By Centre (on priced above Rs 100)		b) Entertainment Tax (30%) - By Local Authorities
		- Further, cap of Rs 120/- on tickets' rate by State government, to prevent exploitative premium charged on keenly awaited films. So, exhibitors need to depend on popcorn vendors for additional incomes.
		- Solution:
			Either State Govt. remove the Cap or Local bodies abolish the entertainment tax as it is not adding much to their revenue.

### EDUCATION
	## Rural Education
		# W.r.t. Integration through Poltical community.
			* The idea that education can serve a village in ways that allow it to retain its best boys and girls had been discarded long ago. Villages became the supplier of talent to the city. Only those who were dependent on land stayed back. With the passage of time, land got subdivided into smaller pieces, making agriculture unattractive. 
			* Struggling youth:
				- The phenomenon of ‘waiting’ to find work
				- Coaching: 
					Coaching now represents an acceptable way of spending much of your youth. It fills time and protects you from feeling constantly frustrated.
					Coaching classes provide access to a peer group where everyone is faced with a similar, chronic crisis.
					Many get absorbed in the coaching industry itself, or in its ancillary industry of private tuition.
			* Rural alienation:
				- Despite better connectivity by road and phone, villages continue to be alienated from the state’s imagination. 
					Quoting P.Chidmabram, once he said "Migration from rural areas has a positive side to it because the state’s services are more accessible in cities."
				- Legitimacy granted to panchayati raj has not diminished the political isolation of the village.
				- Higher productivity and relative prosperity have not given the farming community any political clout or relief from uncertainty.
				- The larger cohort of rural children suffered the consequences of low budgeting and poor staffing. The message that rural children received and absorbed was that they must change their behaviour and values in order to become good citizens. 


### CLIMATE PROOFING DEVELOPMENT
	Definition: 
		Development policies that consider the context of climate change are often called “climate proofing development”.
	Basis to measure poverty:
		OLD:
			- Income alone is no longer considered as being sufficient to estimate and address poverty. One can have assets and a reasonable income and yet be poor in terms of education, nutrition, health and other living conditions. 
			- Using CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty in India to be at 22% of the population in 2011-12
		NEW: 
			- MPI-MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX - tool developed by- Oxaford Poverty & human Development Index(OPHI).
			- Looks at dimensions of education, health and standard of living, giving them all equal weightage. Those who are deprived in at least a third of the weighted indicators are regarded as poor.
			- The most recent MPI for India calculated using India Human Development Survey data of 2011-12, estimates that 41% of the people were multi-dimensionally poor.
	Poors will suffer the worst affect of Climate variablity and climate change. Like:-
		- Sever droughts
		- Flood washing away their livelihood on riverbanks.
	Linking up with the SUSTINABLE DEVLELPOMENT GOALS (SDGs):
		- In 2015, countries agreed to meet 17 universal goals, officially known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
		- 17 SDG goals:
			1: No Poverty 		    2: Zero Hunger 		3: Good Health and Well-being
			4: Quality Education 	5: Gender Equality  6: Clean Water and Sanitation
			7: Affordable and Clean Energy 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
			9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure  10: Reduced Inequalities
			11: Sustainable Cities and Communities		12: Responsible Consumption and Production
			13: Climate Action		14: Life Below Water  15: Life on Land
			16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions	17: Partnerships for the Goals

### MEGA FOOD PARK
	# First Maize Based Mega Food Park in Kapurthala, Punjab
		*The foundation stone for First Maize based Mega Food Park was recently laid in Kapurthala, Punjab. Kapurthala has been declared as a Dark Zone district where slow desertification is happening because of overexploitation of water due to cash crops. Establishment of this Mega Food Park will result in the development of this Dark Zone which includes Job opportunities, Environmental Conservation.

	# Significance of Maize based Mega food park:
		* Maize is an amazing cereal and is an alternate to Jhona (paddy) and Kanak (wheat). Maize is rich in protein, provides nutritional requirements that India needs and Maize consumes much lesser water and could contain the problem of further water depletion.
	    * Maize Based Mega Food Park is the first major and serious step in the history of India for containing the desertification problem of Punjab and would make farmers turn to maize cultivation which need less water for more production.
	    * Maize is being used by different industries for seed, starch, brewery, food additives, sweeteners etc and it is also a basic raw material to thousands of industrial products like oil, proteins, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, beverages, film, textile, gum, value added foods, paper industries, bio-ethanol etc.

	# About Mega Food Parks:
		* To give a major boost to the food processing sector by adding value and reducing food wastage at each stage of the supply chain with particular focus on perishables, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing Mega Food Park Scheme in the country.
		* The Scheme of Mega Food Park aims at providing a mechanism to link agricultural production to the market by bringing together farmers, processors and retailers so as to ensure maximizing value addition, minimizing wastages, increasing farmers’ income and creating employment opportunities particularly in rural sector.

	# Mode of operation:
	    * The Scheme has a cluster based approach based on a hub and spokes model. It includes creation of infrastructure for primary processing and storage near the farm in the form of PRIMARY PROCESSING CENTRES (PPCs) and COLLECTION CENTRES (CCs) and common facilities and enabling infrastructure at CENTRAL PROCESSING CENTRE (CPC).
	    * The PPCs are meant for functioning as a link between the producers and processors for supply of raw material to the Central Processing Centres.
	    CPC has need based core processing facilities and basic enabling infrastructure to be used by the food processing units setup at the CPC. The minimum area required for a CPC is 50 acres.
	    * The scheme is demand-driven and would facilitate food processing units to meet environmental, safety and social standards.


### SEBI - SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA
	# Background:
		* The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the regulator for the securities market in India. It was established in the year 1988 and given statutory powers on 12 April 1992 through the SEBI Act, 1992.

	# Important functions performed by SEBI:
		* Approve by−laws of stock exchanges.


	    * Require the stock exchange to amend their by−laws.
	    * Inspect the books of accounts and call for periodical returns from recognized stock exchanges.
	    * Inspect the books of accounts of financial intermediaries.
	    * Compel certain companies to list their shares in one or more stock exchanges.
	    * Register brokers.

	# SEBI to move against non-compliant firms
		* The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has initiated action against non-compliant “Exclusively Listed Companies (ELCs) on Dissemination Board (DB),” and its directors and promoters. 

	# Non- compliant firms:
		* These are companies which were earlier listed on regional stock exchanges (RSEs) that have been de-recognised by the regulator. Such companies were allowed to be part of the national exchanges through a dissemination board but were directed to submit a plan of action for listing or providing an exit option to shareholders.

	# What’s the issue?
		* These firms were supposed to submit their plan of action. The deadline to submit the plan of action was extended until June 30. As per SEBI, of the 2,000 companies listed on dissemination board as on June 30, there are 536 entities that are traceable and yet not submitted a plan of action.

	# SEBI’s powers to punish non- compliant firms:
		* SEBI can bar such promoters and companies from accessing the securities market for a period of 10 years apart from freezing the shares held by promoters and directors. The regulator can even attach the bank accounts and other assets of promoters and directors to compensate the investors.

### MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (M&A)
	* Background:
		The earlier norms had specified that an application to obtain the CCI’s prior approval for an acquisition, merger or amalgamation had to be filed within thirty days of: board approval of the proposed merger or amalgamation by each of the respective parties; execution of any agreement or other document of a binding nature conveying a decision to acquire shares, control, voting rights or assets; execution of any document by the acquiring enterprise conveying a decision to acquire shares, control, voting rights or assets, in case the acquisition is without the consent of the enterprise being acquired; or date of the public announcement under India’s takeover regulations applicable to acquisitions of listed entities.
	
	# Centre eases pre-merger filing norms
		* In a move that is likely to boost mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the country, the Centre has done away with the thirty-day time period to submit before the Competition Commission of India (CCI) an application for pre-merger clearance.
    	* As per the latest notification, every person or enterprise who is a party to a combination is exempted from giving notice within thirty days. This new provision (exemption from the 30-day time period) will be valid for five years starting June 29, 2017.
    	* The notification means that parties can make a CCI application at any time in course of an acquisition but cannot effect or close an acquisition before obtaining the CCI’s approval.

	# Significance of this move:
		* It will give parties the liberty and flexibility to decide at what stage they want to make the CCI filing, depending on the deal parameters and commercial terms.
		* Besides, this will specifically benefit large, multi-jurisdiction transactions where parties may be burdened with regulatory requirements in several jurisdictions and, therefore, need more time to assess the Indian law implications and prepare a comprehensive CCI application.


### GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE COMMITTEE (GFXC)

	## About GFXC:
		* The Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) was established in May 2017 as a forum bringing together CENTRAL BANKS AND PRIVATE SECTOR participants with the aim to promote a robust, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent foreign exchange market in which a diverse set of participants, supported by resilient infrastructure, are able to confidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available information and in a manner that conforms to acceptable standards of behaviour.

		* The committee has been set up under the guidance of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an international financial organisation owned by 60 member central banks, representing countries from around the world.

		## The objectives of the GFXC are:
	    	* To promote collaboration and communication among the local foreign exchange committees (FXCs) and non-GFXC jurisdictions with significant FX markets;
	    	* To exchange views on trends and developments in global FX markets, including on the structure and functioning of those markets, drawing on information gathered at the various FXCs; and
	    	* To promote, maintain and update on a regular basis the FX Global Code (the Code) and to consider good practices regarding effective mechanisms to support adherence.

	## India to join new global foreign exchange committee
		* India will soon get a seat on the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC), a newly-constituted forum of central bankers and experts working towards promotion of a robust and transparent forex market.

    	* The newly expanded and formalised GFXC, which will meet regularly, replaces a similar but more informal organisation of eight foreign exchange committees — namely those from Australia, Canada, Euro area, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, UK and the US.
    	
    	* The GFXC will also now include representatives from existing, or soon to be established, foreign exchange committees or similar structures in Brazil, China, India, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland.

### BITCOIN:
	## What are CRYPTOCURRENCIES?
		* CRYPTO-CURRENCY that is planned to be brought under the regulatory regime is a digital currency which allows transacting parties to remain anonymous while confirming that the transaction is a valid one. It is not owned or controlled by any institution – governments or private.
		* There are multiple such currencies — bitcoin, ethereum, ripple are some of the popular ones. Currently, they are neither illegal nor legal in India.

	# Bitcoin trade may come under SEBI
		* The government is considering the introduction of a regulatory regime for virtual or crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin, that would enable the levy of the Goods and Services Tax on their sale.
	    * The new regime may possibly bring their trading under the oversight of the stock market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
	
	# Benefits of regulation of these currencies:
		* Proper regulation of these currencies will “promote” a formal tax base, while keeping a tab on their use for illegal activities such as money laundering, terror funding and drug trafficking.

	# Need for regulation:
		* Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in the last few years. Currently, they are neither illegal nor legal in many countries including India. The market cap for all crypto-currencies has just crossed $100 billion, with most of the increase coming in the past few months. On April 1, 2017, the total market cap was just over $25 billion, representing a 300% rise in just over 60 days. One bitcoin today is worth as much as 60 grams of gold.

	# Why banning cryptocurrencies altogether is not a good idea:
		* Banning will give a clear message that all related activities are illegal and will disincetivise those interested in taking speculative risks. It will also impede tax collection on gains made in such activities and that regulating the currency instead would signal a boost to blockchain technology, encourage the development of a supervision ecosystem (that tracks legal activities and may also assist in tracking illegal activities) and promote a formal tax base.

	# Concerns associated with this move:
		* However, the government is wary that regulation will provide legitimacy to “what is currently ambiguous,” and may lead to further rise in its valuation and end up contributing “to the investment bubble”.
