### GST
	# Against the way of GST implementation (by P.Chidambram)-
		POSITIVE SIDE OF GST:-
			a. One tax subsume maby taxes
			b. Captures nearly all transcations above certain limit
			c. Eleminates cascading effect at various level of value chain
			d. Enlarge tax base
		DESIGN FLAWS OF GST:-
			a. GST should have one standard rate (with cocessional rate and demrit rate) but we have several slabs
			b. GST implemented as diarchy but needs to be a unified ax
			c. Number of tar return filings by a merchant is way too high. eg, Per state of trade around 37 times per year.
			d. GST should have eleminated classification dispute, but it didn't.
			e. GST should reduce the discretion of tax administrator but it didn't.
			f. No trial run period. (atleast 2 months must have been given for transational duration) 

### EDUCATION
	## Rural Education
		# W.r.t. Integration through Poltical community.
			* The idea that education can serve a village in ways that allow it to retain its best boys and girls had been discarded long ago. Villages became the supplier of talent to the city. Only those who were dependent on land stayed back. With the passage of time, land got subdivided into smaller pieces, making agriculture unattractive. 
			* Struggling youth:
				- The phenomenon of ‘waiting’ to find work
				- Coaching: 
					Coaching now represents an acceptable way of spending much of your youth. It fills time and protects you from feeling constantly frustrated.
					Coaching classes provide access to a peer group where everyone is faced with a similar, chronic crisis.
					Many get absorbed in the coaching industry itself, or in its ancillary industry of private tuition.
			* Rural alienation:
				- Despite better connectivity by road and phone, villages continue to be alienated from the state’s imagination. 
					Quoting P.Chidmabram, once he said "Migration from rural areas has a positive side to it because the state’s services are more accessible in cities."
				- Legitimacy granted to panchayati raj has not diminished the political isolation of the village.
				- Higher productivity and relative prosperity have not given the farming community any political clout or relief from uncertainty.
				- The larger cohort of rural children suffered the consequences of low budgeting and poor staffing. The message that rural children received and absorbed was that they must change their behaviour and values in order to become good citizens. 


### CLIMATE PROOFING DEVELOPMENT
	Definition: 
		Development policies that consider the context of climate change are often called “climate proofing development”.
	Basis to measure poverty:
		OLD:
			- Income alone is no longer considered as being sufficient to estimate and address poverty. One can have assets and a reasonable income and yet be poor in terms of education, nutrition, health and other living conditions. 
			- Using CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty in India to be at 22% of the population in 2011-12
		NEW: 
			- MPI-MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX - tool developed by- Oxaford Poverty & human Development Index(OPHI).
			- Looks at dimensions of education, health and standard of living, giving them all equal weightage. Those who are deprived in at least a third of the weighted indicators are regarded as poor.
			- The most recent MPI for India calculated using India Human Development Survey data of 2011-12, estimates that 41% of the people were multi-dimensionally poor.
	Poors will suffer the worst affect of Climate variablity and climate change. Like:-
		- Sever droughts
		- Flood washing away their livelihood on riverbanks.
