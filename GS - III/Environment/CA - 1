### Air Pollution
	## Aerosols
		* Greenhouse gases, or GHGs, are causing concern about the long-term fate of the Indian monsoon, researchers now think aerosols from vehicular exhaust, half-burnt crop residue, dust and chemical effluents may be weakening the life-giving rainy season even more than GHGs.
		* Dust clouds shield the earth from the sun’s rays, depressing land and sea temperatures and reducing the variation between the two.
		* A good monsoon, which is produced by the difference in temperature between land and sea, is thus weakened by aerosol accumulation. 

### OPEN ACRES - The new hydrocarbon policy opens us exploration 
	* The recently unveiled OPEN ACREAGE LICENSING POLICY and the NATIONAL DATA REPOSITORY together are a significant and welcome step towards opening up the hydrocarbon exploration and production industry in India.
	* Benifit to the companies:
		- Can bid for particular areas.
		- Extra 5 points to company already working at that location
		- National Data Repository, which is envisaged as a centralised database of geological and hydrocarbon information that will be available to all.
		- There are a number of companies around the world that make it their business to simply explore hydrocarbon basins and sell the information they gather.
	* Benifits to the Government:
		- Attractive areas to be under bid.
		- Better chance to woo serious energy investors in an effort to help achieve a more cohesive framework of the country’s energy security.  
		- India can attract enough investment to meet the government’s objective of reducing oil imports by 10% by 2022, especially given the past experience investors have had with large projects such as KG-D6.


### BOTTOM TRAWLING - Sri Lanka bans bottom-trawling (Pic attached)
	* Sri Lanka has banned the destructive fishing practice of bottom-trawling in their waters, making violators liable for a fine of LKR 50,000 (approximately ₹20,000) and face two years imprisonment. In this regard, an Amendment to the country’s Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act was passed unanimously, in effect declaring the fishing method an offence.

	# Why the ban?
		* Bottom trawling is a destructive fishing practice which affects the marine ecosystem. The practice, which involves trawlers dragging weighted nets along the sea floor, is known to cause great depletion of fishery resources, and curbing it is in the interest of sustainable fishing.
		* For more please check the image "Hazard of Bottom Trawling in Fishery.jpg"

	# Concerns raised by Tamil Nadu:
		* The development could directly impact a section of fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who engage in bottom-trawling and have often been found trespassing into Sri Lanka’s territorial waters.


### UNESCO
	## UNESCO puts HEBRON on endangered heritage list, outraging Israel:
		# ABOUT HEBRON:
		    * Hebron is part of the West Bank, a territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The international community considers it to be occupied.
		    * Palestinians claim the West Bank is an integral part of a future independent state, a position that is widely backed internationally. Israel says the territory’s fate, along with other core issues like security, should be resolved in negotiations.
		    * Both Jews and Muslims revere the same site in Hebron as the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs and matriarchs — Jews call it the Tomb of the Patriarchs, while for Muslims it is the Ibrahimi Mosque.
		* The U.N. cultural agency has declared the old city in the West Bank town of Hebron as a Palestinian world heritage site, a decision that outraged Israeli officials who say the move negated the deep Jewish ties to the biblical town and its ancient shrine.
		* The move was the latest chapter in Israel’s contentious relationship with UNESCO, an agency it accuses of being an anti-Israeli tool that makes decisions out of political considerations.


	## UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE:
		* A UNESCO World Heritage Site is a place that is listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as of special cultural or physical significance.

	    * The list is maintained by the international World Heritage Programme administered by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, composed of 21 UNESCO member states which are elected by the General Assembly.
    	
    	* Each World Heritage Site remains part of the legal territory of the state wherein the site is located and UNESCO considers it in the interest of the international community to preserve each site.
		
		# New sites get UNESCO heritage tag
			* The United Nations’ cultural agency has added 22 heritage treasures to its list of World Heritage sites. The additions come as the AGENCY MEETS IN POLAND FOR AN 11-DAY session to nominate new locations in need of protection and reviews the status and well-being of existing designated sites.

		    * The UNESCO designation, which recognizes the outstanding universal values of the sites, is meant to draw attention to them and the need to preserve them.

		# New additions:
			The UNESCO World Heritage List Committee designated Britain’s LAKE DISTRICT, the BADEN-WUERTTEMBERG CAVES in Germany, and the modernist architecture in ASMARA — the capital city of Eritrea — to the roster of places with special recognition.

		    Among the other new sites on the UNESCO list are: the underground mines in TARNOWSKIE GORY IN POLAND, the historic city of YAZD, in Iran; Japan’s sacred and restricted-access island of OKINOSHIMA, and LOS ALERCES NATIONAL PARK in Argentina.
		    Also added were Turkey’s 3rd century B.C. APHRODISIAS TEMPLE and the VALONGO WHARF ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

### GODAVARI:
	# About Godavari River:
		* The Godavari is the second longest river in India after the river Ganges having its source at Tryambakeshwar, Maharashtra.

	    * It starts in Maharashtra and flows east for 1,465 kilometres (910 mi) emptying into Bay of Bengal draining the Indian states Maharashtra (48.6%), Telangana(18.8%), Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Chhattisgarh (10.9%), Madhya Pradesh (10.0%), Odisha (5.7%), Karnataka (1.4%) and Puducherry through its extensive network of tributaries. - 8 STATES
	    
	    * Measuring up to 312,812 km2 (120,777 sq mi), it forms one of the largest river basins in the Indian subcontinent, with only the Ganges and Indus rivers having a drainage basin larger than it in India.
	    
	    * Important tributaries include PRAVARA, PURNA, MANJIRA, PRANHITA, INDRAVATI and SABARI.

	## SENSOR NETWORK TO MAP AND PREDICT POLLUTION, EFFLUENTS IN GODAVARI
		* A group of U.S. researchers is working on a SYSTEM TO MAP UNDULATING POLLUTION TRENDS IN THE GODAVARI, India’s second longest river.

    	* Using a mix of methods, including SATELLITE-MONITORING, TRAVERSING STRETCHES of the river to collect water samples and using special SENSORS TO MEASURE BACTERIAL AND CHEMICAL POLLUTION, the researchers are trying to develop a cost-effective forecast system.
    	* Through cloud-based data collection and real-time mapping systems, the research and implementation teams intend to demonstrate the importance and value of detecting and anticipating pollutants that enter the river in the form of human waste, organic materials, and chemical contaminants.
    	* The exercise is part of a BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION PROJECT to support the programme of the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) to provide city-wide sanitation improvements in urban Andhra Pradesh. Sensors to monitor river pollution are an emerging technological approach in India.

		# Objectives of the project:
		    * The long-term objective is to be able to inform State officials and citizens of a probable spike in, say, levels of dangerous microbes or effluents, similar to weather and air pollution forecasts.
    		* Also, it is to be able to ACCESS “RAW DATA” that could be used to inform the efficacy of a proposed faecal sludge treatment plant and whether behavioural interventions — including incentives or punishments — to restrict activities that pollute the river could actually work.
