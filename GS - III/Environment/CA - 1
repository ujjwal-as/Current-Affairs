### Air Pollution
	## Aerosols
		* Greenhouse gases, or GHGs, are causing concern about the long-term fate of the Indian monsoon, researchers now think aerosols from vehicular exhaust, half-burnt crop residue, dust and chemical effluents may be weakening the life-giving rainy season even more than GHGs.
		* Dust clouds shield the earth from the sun’s rays, depressing land and sea temperatures and reducing the variation between the two.
		* A good monsoon, which is produced by the difference in temperature between land and sea, is thus weakened by aerosol accumulation. 

### OPEN ACRES - The new hydrocarbon policy opens us exploration 
	* The recently unveiled OPEN ACREAGE LICENSING POLICY and the NATIONAL DATA REPOSITORY together are a significant and welcome step towards opening up the hydrocarbon exploration and production industry in India.
	* Benifit to the companies:
		- Can bid for particular areas.
		- Extra 5 points to company already working at that location
		- National Data Repository, which is envisaged as a centralised database of geological and hydrocarbon information that will be available to all.
		- There are a number of companies around the world that make it their business to simply explore hydrocarbon basins and sell the information they gather.
	* Benifits to the Government:
		- Attractive areas to be under bid.
		- Better chance to woo serious energy investors in an effort to help achieve a more cohesive framework of the country’s energy security.  
		- India can attract enough investment to meet the government’s objective of reducing oil imports by 10% by 2022, especially given the past experience investors have had with large projects such as KG-D6.
