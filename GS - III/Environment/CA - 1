### Air Pollution
	## Aerosols
		* Greenhouse gases, or GHGs, are causing concern about the long-term fate of the Indian monsoon, researchers now think aerosols from vehicular exhaust, half-burnt crop residue, dust and chemical effluents may be weakening the life-giving rainy season even more than GHGs.
		* Dust clouds shield the earth from the sunâ€™s rays, depressing land and sea temperatures and reducing the variation between the two.
		* A good monsoon, which is produced by the difference in temperature between land and sea, is thus weakened by aerosol accumulation.
