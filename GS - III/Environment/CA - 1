	## Aerosols
		* Greenhouse gases, or GHGs, are causing concern about the long-term fate of the Indian monsoon, researchers now think aerosols from vehicular exhaust, half-burnt crop residue, dust and chemical effluents may be weakening the life-giving rainy season even more than GHGs.
		* Dust clouds shield the earth from the sun’s rays, depressing land and sea temperatures and reducing the variation between the two.
		* A good monsoon, which is produced by the difference in temperature between land and sea, is thus weakened by aerosol accumulation. 

### OPEN ACRES - The new hydrocarbon policy opens us exploration 
	* The recently unveiled OPEN ACREAGE LICENSING POLICY and the NATIONAL DATA REPOSITORY together are a significant and welcome step towards opening up the hydrocarbon exploration and production industry in India.
	* Benifit to the companies:
		- Can bid for particular areas.
		- Extra 5 points to company already working at that location
		- National Data Repository, which is envisaged as a centralised database of geological and hydrocarbon information that will be available to all.
		- There are a number of companies around the world that make it their business to simply explore hydrocarbon basins and sell the information they gather.
	* Benifits to the Government:
		- Attractive areas to be under bid.
		- Better chance to woo serious energy investors in an effort to help achieve a more cohesive framework of the country’s energy security.  
		- India can attract enough investment to meet the government’s objective of reducing oil imports by 10% by 2022, especially given the past experience investors have had with large projects such as KG-D6.


### BOTTOM TRAWLING - Sri Lanka bans bottom-trawling (Pic attached)
	* Sri Lanka has banned the destructive fishing practice of bottom-trawling in their waters, making violators liable for a fine of LKR 50,000 (approximately ₹20,000) and face two years imprisonment. In this regard, an Amendment to the country’s Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act was passed unanimously, in effect declaring the fishing method an offence.

	# Why the ban?
		* Bottom trawling is a destructive fishing practice which affects the marine ecosystem. The practice, which involves trawlers dragging weighted nets along the sea floor, is known to cause great depletion of fishery resources, and curbing it is in the interest of sustainable fishing.

	# Concerns raised by Tamil Nadu:
		* The development could directly impact a section of fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who engage in bottom-trawling and have often been found trespassing into Sri Lanka’s territorial waters.


### UNESCO
	## UNESCO puts HEBRON on endangered heritage list, outraging Israel:
		# ABOUT HEBRON:
		    * Hebron is part of the West Bank, a territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The international community considers it to be occupied.
		    * Palestinians claim the West Bank is an integral part of a future independent state, a position that is widely backed internationally. Israel says the territory’s fate, along with other core issues like security, should be resolved in negotiations.
		    * Both Jews and Muslims revere the same site in Hebron as the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs and matriarchs — Jews call it the Tomb of the Patriarchs, while for Muslims it is the Ibrahimi Mosque.
		* The U.N. cultural agency has declared the old city in the West Bank town of Hebron as a Palestinian world heritage site, a decision that outraged Israeli officials who say the move negated the deep Jewish ties to the biblical town and its ancient shrine.
		* The move was the latest chapter in Israel’s contentious relationship with UNESCO, an agency it accuses of being an anti-Israeli tool that makes decisions out of political considerations.
