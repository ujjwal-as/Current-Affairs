### KERALA
	## IBAs (Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas)
		* 9 new Bird & Biodiversity locations identifed in Kerala:
			1. Achencoil Forest Division		2. Anamudi Shola National Park
			3. Camel's Hump Mountain, Wayanad	4.MuthiKulam Siruvani
			5. Kurinjimala Wildlife Sanctury	6. Malayattoor Reserve Forest
			7. Manakulam Forest Division		8. Mathikettan Shola National Park
			9. Pampadum Shola National Park
		* Now Kerala have 33 IBAs. Moreover Kerala's IBAs are home to 3 critcally endangered species:
			Whiterumped Vulture,		Indian Vulture,		Red-headed Vulture 

	## RET(Rare Endemic and Threatened) species:
		- Botanical Survey of India documeted 250 RET Species in Western Ghats (Kerala & T.N.), with nearly 177 in Kerala's Wayanad district especially from biodiversity hotspots like KURICHYARMALA, RANIMALA, ARANAMALA, CHEMBRA PEAK, PERIYA and KURUVA island
		- Poorly documented, heavily exploited or habitat-deprived species such as KINGIODENDRON PINNATUM, known in Malayalam as CHUKANNAPAYINI, CYNOMETRA TRAVANCORICA, VATERIA INDICA and HOPEA PARVIFLORA now have better records.
		- Medicinally important plants:
			AGLAIA MALABARICA (critically endangered in the Red List), 
			MYRISTICA MALABARICA (vulnerable), 
			SYZIGIUM STOCKSII and 
			SYZIGIUM DHANESHIANA
		- Economically important ones like 
			HUMBOLDTIA VAHLIANA (unsustainably collection)
			HOPEA PONGA 


### TIGER 
	# Tiger reserve to remain close during masoon in Rajasthan.
		* Reserves affected: Ranathambore and Sarsika Tiger Reserve
		* Matter taken to state by: NTCA-National Tiger Conservation Authority  
	# ‘White tiger’ spotted in the Nilgiris
		- Forest officials on whether it is a true genetic mutant.
		- Estimated to be 'colour morphism'
		- "Natural polymorphiism": 
			A genetic mutation among tigers that changes an amino acid responsible for the normal colour being formed, resulting in “natural polymorphism” (occurring in different forms).
		- Such cats lack PHEOMELANIN, which is responsible for the red-yellow hue in the skin coat. 


### NARMADA DAM - SARDAR SAROVAR DAM
	# Current Issue:
		* The NARMADA CONTROL AUTHORITY decided on June 17, 2017 to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam to its full height, by ordering the closure of 30 gates.
		* Due to protest once, World Bank had to withdraw the loan provided for Dam.
		* PROBLEMS:
			* Siltation - a Problem:
				- In 85% of India’s dams, the actual rates of siltation are higher than those anticipated during their design.
				- An alarming one in four dams has sedimentation rates more than five times as high as expected!
				- Severe for giant dams such as the Sardar Sarovar, which cannot be easily desilted. 
				-  As a result, the capacity to generate hydropower is affected. 
				- A dam choked with silt creates a river prone to risky situations of potential flooding in the backwaters.
			* Rehablitation
				- No proper compensation in terms of land: 
					Land unsuitable for farming or living, located either on riverbeds at the risk of flooding, or in rocky areas which cannot be ploughed. 
				- Resettlement sites not ready and lack basic facilities: 
					No wells, drinking water pipelines, or grazing land for cattle, let alone schools or road facilities. 
				- No prior resettlement plan:
					Tens of thousands of additional households are now being asked to rely on resettlement without an adequately provisioned place to move.
				- Only to them who only can prove the loss of home with proper documents.
				- Vachan Patras;
					Employees from government departments are trying to force people to sign ‘Vachan Patras’ agreeing to shift before July 15, with a vague statement that “I am willing to take whatever benefits government offers as per the rules”. 
				- Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana:
					The Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister has promised to provide houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to some families, but house plots will be returned to about 5,000 families that had been paid money in lieu of plots by the authorities.
			* Salination at Narmada estuary.

		* CONSEQUENCE of this particular step:
			- It will submerge one town and at least 176 villages, displace close to 20,000 families,
			- Flood productive agricultural land,
			- Destroy hundreds of acres of biodiverse forest,
			- No proper Rehabilitation will leads to Unemployment, Health issues and Poverty.


### Suderban Delta miracle:
	* Sunderban: 
		- Third of the largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem in the world, is a reminder that an accelerated effort is necessary to preserve them.
		- Unique population of tigers that live here, adapted to move easily across the land-sea interface.
		- As a confluence zone of freshwater brought by the big Himalayan rivers and high concentrated salinity, these islands are a crucible of biodiversity that helps the 4.5 million that live on the Indian side.
		- Sundari Tree:
			Mangrove tree species, Sundari, has historically helped the local economy in the construction of boats and bridges, make up as much as a third of the global trove of such trees. 
	* Long term damage caused by colonial era, where forest were cut for cultivation
	* Preventive Steps:
		a) Protect the banks from erosion, and policies that address the pressures created on natural resources by lack of human development.
		b) Ecotourism holds the potential to raise awareness and funds, since the Sundarbans harbour a raft of bird and animal species.
		c) International climate finance to be channelled to India and Bangladesh for the region’s preservation, given its global uniqueness.
		d) Local communities has to be pulled out of poverty, which would also relieve the pressure on natural resources.


### Earth facing SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION
	* The sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is unfolding more quickly than feared, scientists have warned. Scientists call this as a case of biological annihilation occurring globally.

    * Globally, the mass die-off — deemed to be the sixth in the last half-billion years — is the worst since three-quarters of life on the Earth, including the non-avian dinosaurs, were wiped out 66 million years ago by a giant meteor impact. On an average, two vertebrate species disappear every year.

	# Supporting data:
	    * More than 30% of animals with a backbone — fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals — are declining in both range and population.
	    * The mammal species that were monitored have lost at least a third of their original habitat. 40% of them — including rhinos, orangutans, gorillas and many big cats — are surviving on 20% or less of the land they once roamed. The loss of biodiversity has recently accelerated.
    	* Several species of mammals that were relatively safe one or two decades ago are now endangered, including cheetahs, lions and giraffes. There are as few as 20,000 lions left in the wild, less than 7,000 cheetahs, 500 to 1,000 giant pandas, and about 250 Sumatran rhinoceros.
    	* Tropical regions have seen the highest number of declining species. In South and Southeast Asia, large-bodied species of mammals have lost more than four-fifths of their historical ranges.
    	* While fewer species are disappearing in temperate zones, the percentage is just as high or higher. As many as half of the number of animals that once shared our planet are no longer here, a loss described as “a massive erosion of the greatest biological diversity in the history of Earth”.

	# Factors behind the loss?
		* The main drivers of wildlife decline are habitat loss, overconsumption, pollution, invasive species, disease, as well as poaching in the case of tigers, elephants, rhinos and other large animals prized for their body parts. Climate change is poised to become a major threat in the coming decades.
