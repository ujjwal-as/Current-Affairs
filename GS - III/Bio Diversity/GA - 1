### IBAs (Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas)
	* 9 new Bird & Biodiversity locations identifed in Kerala:
		1. Achencoil Forest Division		2. Anamudi Shola National Park
		3. Camel's Hump Mountain, Wayanad	4.MuthiKulam Siruvani
		5. Kurinjimala Wildlife Sanctury	6. Malayattoor Reserve Forest
		7. Manakulam Forest Division		8. Mathikettan Shola National Park
		9. Pampadum Shola National Park
	* Now Kerala have 33 IBAs. Moreover Kerala's IBAs are home to 3 critcally endangered species:
		Whiterumped Vulture,		Indian Vulture,		Red-headed Vulture 

### Tiger reserve to remain close during masoon in Rajasthan.
	* Reserves affected: Ranathambore and Sarsika Tiger Reserve
	* Matter taken to state by: NTCA-National Tiger Conservation Authority  

### Narmada Dam - Sardar Sarovar Dam
	# Current Issue:
		* The NARMADA CONTROL AUTHORITY decided on June 17, 2017 to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam to its full height, by ordering the closure of 30 gates.
		* PROBLEMS:
			* Siltation - a Problem:
				- In 85% of India’s dams, the actual rates of siltation are higher than those anticipated during their design.
				- An alarming one in four dams has sedimentation rates more than five times as high as expected!
				- Severe for giant dams such as the Sardar Sarovar, which cannot be easily desilted. 
				-  As a result, the capacity to generate hydropower is affected. 
				- A dam choked with silt creates a river prone to risky situations of potential flooding in the backwaters.
			* Rehablitation
				- No proper compensation in terms of land: 
					Land unsuitable for farming or living, located either on riverbeds at the risk of flooding, or in rocky areas which cannot be ploughed. 
				- Resettlement sites lack basic facilities: 
					No wells, drinking water pipelines, or grazing land for cattle, let alone schools or road facilities. 
				- No prior resettlement plan:
					Tens of thousands of additional households are now being asked to rely on resettlement without an adequately provisioned place to move.
				- Only to them who only can prove the loss of home with proper documents.
			* Salination at Narmada estuary.

		* Consequence of this particular step:
			- It will submerge one town and at least 176 villages, displace close to 20,000 families,
			- Flood productive agricultural land, and 
			- Destroy hundreds of acres of biodiverse forest. 

### Suderban Delta miracle:
	* Sunderban: 
		- Third of the largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem in the world, is a reminder that an accelerated effort is necessary to preserve them.
		- Unique population of tigers that live here, adapted to move easily across the land-sea interface.
		- As a confluence zone of freshwater brought by the big Himalayan rivers and high concentrated salinity, these islands are a crucible of biodiversity that helps the 4.5 million that live on the Indian side.
		- Sundari Tree:
			Mangrove tree species, Sundari, has historically helped the local economy in the construction of boats and bridges, make up as much as a third of the global trove of such trees. 
	* Long term damage caused by colonial era, where forest were cut for cultivation
	* Preventive Steps:
		a) Protect the banks from erosion, and policies that address the pressures created on natural resources by lack of human development.
		b) Ecotourism holds the potential to raise awareness and funds, since the Sundarbans harbour a raft of bird and animal species.
		c) International climate finance to be channelled to India and Bangladesh for the region’s preservation, given its global uniqueness.
		d) Local communities has to be pulled out of poverty, which would also relieve the pressure on natural resources.
